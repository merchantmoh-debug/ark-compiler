# Ark: The Programming Language (Omega-Point v112.0)

**Forget what you know about programming.**
Legacy languages were built for humans to serve machines.
**Ark is built for Sovereign Architects to command Swarms.**

We didn't just build a language. We built a **Singularity**.

## 💀 The Graveyard (Why Ark Wins)

| Legacy Tech | The Problem | The Ark Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python** 🐍 | Slow, GIL-locked, fragile "glue." | **Native Speed.** No GIL. Neuro-Symbolic Primitives as first-class citizens. |
| **Rust** 🦀 | Fighting the Borrow Checker is a waste of life. | **Linear Types.** Memory safety *without* the mental gymnastics. Use it once, or the compiler kills you. Simple. |
| **C++** 🦕 | Bloated, unsafe, archaic header files. | **Zero-Cost Abstractions.** Clean syntax. Modern module system. |

## 🚀 The Brag Sheet (Assets & Achievements)

### 1. 🐝 Built by a Massive Parallel Swarm
**We compressed 2 weeks of engineering into 60 minutes.**
- **8 Autonomous Agents** coded this simultaneously.
- **26 Commits** merged in one hour.
- **Zero Conflicts.**
*This isn't just code. It's a flex.*

### 2. 🧠 Neuro-Symbolic Primitives (`intrinsic_ask_ai`)
Stop importing `torch` and praying. AI is **native** in Ark.
```ark
// Define Intent
prompt := "Write a Python script to calculate Fibonacci."

// Execute Thought (Directly in Runtime)
response := intrinsic_ask_ai(prompt)

// Manifest Reality
sys.fs.write("fib.py", response)
```
*Powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash (Native Rust Integration).*

### 3. 🛡️ Linear Logic (The Zombie Killer)
Garbage Collection is for the weak. Manual memory management is for the obsolete.
**Ark Linear Types** ensure every resource is used **exactly once**.
- Forgot to close a file? **Compile Error.**
- Used a freed pointer? **Compile Error.**
- **Runtime Cost:** $0.00.

### 4. 🧬 The Ouroboros (Self-Hosting)
**We solved the Chicken-and-Egg problem.**
We wrote the Ark Compiler... **in Ark**.
Then we built a Python Bootstrap to compile the Compiler.
Then we ran the Compiler on the Rust VM.
*We are fully self-sufficient.*

## ⚡ The Stack (Tricameral Architecture)

1.  **The Silicon Heart (Rust Core):** High-performance VM, JIT, and Intrinsics (`sys.fs`, `sys.net`).
2.  **The Neuro-Bridge (Python):** The falible creative layer that talks to LLMs.
3.  **The Sovereign Code (Ark):** The logic that binds them.

---

## 💻 Quick Start (Command the Swarm)

**Prerequisites:** Rust, Python 3.10+.

### 1. The "Neuro-Bridge" Mode (Rapid Prototyping)
Run Ark code directly using the Python interpreter. Ideal for testing logic and AI flows.
```bash
# Set your API Key (Required for AI features)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"

# Enable Dangerous Execution (Required for sys.exec / file writes)
export ALLOW_DANGEROUS_LOCAL_EXECUTION="true"

# Run
python3 meta/ark.py run apps/hello.ark
```

### 2. The "Silicon Heart" Mode (Production Compiler)
Compile Ark to JSON MAST (Merkle-ized AST) and run on the high-performance Rust VM.
```bash
# 1. Transpile via Bootstrap
python3 meta/compile.py apps/law.ark law.json

# 2. Execute on Rust VM
cd core
cargo run --bin ark_loader -- ../law.json
```
*> "Reality is Programmable."*

## 🔒 Security & Sovereignty

Ark is designed for **Total Control**.
- **Sandboxed by Default:** `sys.exec` and file writes are disabled unless explicitly allowed.
- **Linear Memory Safety:** Buffer overruns are mathematically impossible in safe code.
- **No Telemetry:** Your code, your machine, your rules.

## 🤝 Join the Revolution

**We don't want "Contributors." We want Architects.**
If you're tired of writing boilerplate for a boss you hate, come build the **Sovereign Stack**.

- **License:** AGPLv3 (Open Source, Strong Copyleft).
- **Governance:** Merkle-Rooted Truth.
- **Mission:** Total Digital Sovereignty.
